BasicGame
=========

This is will be a basic top down game engine in C#

I planned to write a modular game engine with a collection of different render engines (OpenGl, GDI++ etc).
I have abandoned this since I ended up only working on the OpenGl engine.
Instead I have now started the OpenGlGame project, have a look at that.
